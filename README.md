# Music Visualiser Project

Name: Kathlyn O'Neill

Student Number: C18359766

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
For this assignment we had to create a visual art piece of game that would repond to whatever music being played or have it be inspired by a particular type of music. The assignment was to follow the line given which was "Something beautiful to enjoy while listening to music".

I decided to do a visual art piece which was inspired by a particular piece of music. The music I chose was a song called Run Away From Me by DotEXE. This song has a happy memory linked to it in my head so that is why I chose this piece. Also as the song is drumstep it should respond well in a visual art piece form.

# How it works

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
From doing this assignment, I am proud of being able to sit down and read through code and begin to understand pieces of it. I find the amount of code sometimes to be overwhelming and therefore difficult to understand what piece does what. However, from looking through code and doing some self directed learning, I have gathered a bit more confidence when it comes to dealing with more complicated and code abundant tasks.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
