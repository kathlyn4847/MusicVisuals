# Music Visualiser Project

Name: Kathlyn O'Neill

Student Number: C18359766

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
For this assignment we had to create a visual art piece of game that would repond to whatever music being played or have it be inspired by a particular type of music. The assignment was to follow the line given which was "Something beautiful to enjoy while listening to music".

I decided to do a visual art piece which was inspired by a particular piece of music. The music I chose was a song called Run Away From Me by DotEXE. This song has a happy memory linked to it in my head so that is why I chose this piece. Also as the song is drumstep it should respond well in a visual art piece form.

# Instructions
This was compiled and ran on MAC. 
1. Run the code and it will be a blank black screen
2. Using the number keys at the top of the keyboard you can select different visuals.
3. The visuals are :
	1. White line
	2. Rotating Cubes
	3. Two spheres
	4. Large sphere with small sphere in centre 
	5. White line, Rotating cubes and two spheres
	
4. Hitting space will restart the song from the beginning.

# How it works

The main file is MusicProject. This will call all the connected files such as Cubes, RotatingSpheres and other visual files needed. You call the viuals by using the number keys allowing them to be hidden or to be displayed. 

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
From doing this assignment, I am proud of being able to sit down and read through code and begin to understand pieces of it. I find the amount of code sometimes to be overwhelming and therefore difficult to understand what piece does what. However, from looking through code and doing some self directed learning in terms of understanding our code from class in more detail, I have gathered a bit more confidence when it comes to dealing with more complicated and code abundant tasks. While I need to still focus on this and be able to apply it to my work the progress I felt I have made is something I am proud of.I am happy with how my visual art piece turned out as I think it works wel with the song even with its simplicity.
- It works well
- The colours look nice
- The song I think works well with this kind of project
- I understand the code I used
- The camera positioning worked as at first it excluded certain visuals after others had been displayed
